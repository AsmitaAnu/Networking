#### What is Docker ?
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.
#### why we used Docker ?
1. Skip the code faster :- Docker users on average ship software 7x more frequently than non-Docker users
2. Standerdized operation :- Small containerized applications make it easy to deploy, identify issues, and roll back for remediation.
3. Seamlessly Move :- Docker-based appliaction can be seamlessly move from the local development to the product base 
4. Save Money :- Docker container help us to run more code on each server, improve your utilization and save money.

## Basic Commands
1. docker images

3. docker images --no-trunc

#### Steps after creating Dockerfile
docker build .
docker container run -it --name namedockerfile dockerid  [this command is basically used run the container in the interactive mode]
#### what is dockerfile, Image and container ?

**DockerFile** is a set of instuction file which help use in producing the Docker Image.
**Image** It is a kind of read-only template crafted with source code, libaries, external dependencies, tools, and other miscellaneous files that are needed for any software application to run successfully on any platform or OS.  
**container** A container is nothing but a box that has the ability to run the docker image templates. 
A container can also be considered as a cohesive software unit that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.  
#### Docker Image vs Containers
1. The key difference between a Docker image Vs a container is that a Docker image is a read-only immutable template that defines how a container will be realized. A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image that gets created when the $ docker run command is implemented.  
2. Before the docker container can even exist docker templates/images are built using $ docker build CLI. 
3. Docker image templates can exist in isolation but containers can't exist without images.  
4. So docker image is an integral part of containers that differs only because of their objectives which we have already covered.  
5. Docker images can’t be paused or started but a Docker container is a run time instance that can be started or paused. 
#### Command to check the **process id** :- **ps -ef**
#### How to push ur image in the repository?
1. docker login [provide ur username and password of github].
2. docker tag imageid repositoryname:v1
3. check the docker images updated with ur tag.
4. docker push repositoryname:tag
#### Where should be the data stored ?
Container is ephermel in nature. when containers are stopped data is not accessible. Container is stored in each host. The container filesystem wasn't designed for high performance I/O.
#### what are Docker Volume ?
Docker volumes are widely used and useful tools for ensuring data persistence while working in containers. Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container.
The volumes are stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle. This allows users to back up data and share file systems between containers easily.
**Location of Docker volume ** :- /var/lib/docker/volume
#### what is Bind Mount ?
Bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes. When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. 
#### what is tmpfs Mount ?
Stored only in a host's memory in linux.
#### what is the difference between volume and mount ?
Bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes. When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. By contrast , Volume will create the new directory within the Docker’s storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory’s contents.
Type of Network
1. Bridge : It is the default network drive. If we don't specify network then Bridge is the default network in the container.
2. overlay : Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other. You can also use overlay networks to facilitate communication between a swarm service and a standalone container, or between two standalone containers on different Docker daemons.
3. None : For this container, disable all networking.
4. Host : For standalone containers, remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and use the host’s networking directly.
5. macvlan : Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network, rather than routed through the Docker host’s network stack.
** Docker Network command

** Command to create network
docker network create --driver bridge mynet
Endpoints: It basicaaly connect your container with network
Puublished Port
1.Container are by default connected to bridge network.
2. Container have outbound network access but no inbound network access.
3. ports must be published to allow inbound network access.
DNS
Load Balancing
