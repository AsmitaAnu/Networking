## What is a network ? 

When two and more computers connect with each other it is called **Network**.
But when two and more computers connect and share data/ resources then we call it **Networking**.

#### What is LAN & WAN ?

Local Area Networking and Wide Area Networking

Suppose, In Mumbai we have one switch with a different port in which we can connect 2-3 computers to it  and that switch is connected to the router.So, that particular area is called LAN.

When 2 different area LANs are connected to each other then we call it WAN.
WANs are of two types 
* Public
* Private
#### What is Router?

When we connect two or more different networks then we call it Router.
 
#### What is the Internet ?

The Internet is basically called the Network of networks. It is a combo of a small network and a big network then we call it Internet.

#### What is Switch in Networking ?

A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN*) and forwards data packets to and from those devices.

#### What is the difference between a MAC address and an IP address?

Network switches refer to MAC addresses in order to send Internet traffic to the right devices, not IP addresses and Every device that connects to the Internet has an IP address. An IP address is a series of alphanumeric characters, like 192.0.2.255 or 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

#### what is Router ?

It is a network device which works as a traffic controller. it's main purpose is to choose a congestion free path to send the data packets .
otherway, Router is a network device which is used to connect different network with each other. 

#### what is ISP Network ?

The term “internet service provider (ISP)” refers to a company that provides access to the internet to both personal and business customers. ISPs make it possible for their customers to surf the web, shop online, conduct business, and connect with family and friends—all for a fee.

#### What is IP Address in Network ?

An IP address is a long string of numbers assigned to every device connected to a network that uses Internet Protocol as the medium for communication.

There are 2 types of IP Address:-
* IPv4 : IPv4 is the fourth version of IP,The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses.Eg :- 192.149.252.76 
* IPv6 : IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) , IPv6 is a 128-bit IP address which supports 2^128 Internet addresses in total.The use of IPv6 not only solves the problem of limited network addresses resources but also resolves the barriers for multiple access devices to connect to the Internet. Eg:- 3ffe:1900:fe21:4545:0000:0000:0000:0000

#### what is Network Model ?

There are two type of Network :
* OSI Networking Model
* TCP/IP Network
